## Initial setup

For any of the busts related features to work, you first need to do the following (once).

Add the following scripts to your project:
- Rachnera Bust
- Bust Config

Also drop the busts/ folder into the Pictures/ folder of your project.

## Show busts for dialogues

Add the following script below the setup ones, and preferably below other scripts modifying the text box:
- Rachnera Message Bust

If you one day wish to remove that feature but not other bust related ones, just delete that one script
